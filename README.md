🛒 E-commerce Wishlist Out-of-Stock Cleaner (Console Script)
This is a robust JavaScript snippet designed to be executed directly in your browser's console to safely and systematically remove "Out of Stock" items from a dynamic e-commerce wishlist page.
✨ Features
100% Safety Guarantee: Employs a dynamic, recursive checking mechanism to ensure in-stock items are never deleted. It only targets items actively marked as "Out of Stock."
Stable Deletion: Solves the common "skipping" issue (where deleting one item causes the next to shift) by re-querying the page for the next out-of-stock item after every successful removal.
Reliable Timing: Includes a 2-second (2000ms) delay between each removal click, giving the website time to process the DOM update without errors or throttling.
Detailed Logging: Logs the Item ID and Name of every item being removed directly to the console for full transparency.
🛠️ How to Use
This script requires no installation and can be run in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
Step-by-Step Instructions
Go to Your Wishlist: Navigate to the specific page on the e-commerce website that displays your full wishlist.
Open the Developer Console:
Windows/Linux: Press F12 or Ctrl + Shift + J.
macOS: Press Cmd + Option + J.
Copy the Script: Copy the entire JavaScript code block (found in wishlist_cleaner.js) into your clipboard.
Paste and Run:
Click the Console tab in the Developer Tools.
Paste the script into the console prompt.
Press Enter.
Monitor the Process: The script will start logging its actions. Do not interact with the page while the script is running, as any click or scroll might disrupt the deletion queue.
⚠️ Important Note on Page Reloads
This script is highly resilient to visual shifting, but it is not resilient to a full page reload. If the website forces a full page refresh after a deletion, the script will stop.
If this happens:
Wait for the page to finish reloading.
Repeat Step 4 (Paste and Run) to let the script clean up the remaining out-of-stock items.
💻 Technical Details (How it Works)
The script relies on the following structure found on the website to function correctly:
Target Element
Selector Used
Purpose
Out-of-Stock Indicator
.itemcard-outOfStockText
Finds items that need to be deleted.
Main Item Container
.itemcard-itemCard
The parent container that holds the ID and the removal button.
Removal Button
.itemcard-removeIcon > span
The clickable element used to delete the item.

The findAndRemoveNextItem function recursively calls itself after a 2-second delay, ensuring it always operates on the most current view of the page, preventing index errors and guaranteeing safety.
